If the condition isn't met, the code in the statement isn't executed. You can string these along using else if and else statements. If the conditions for the first if statment aren't met, then it proceeds to check for the else if (or in python, elif) statement and going from there, if those conditions aren't met, it'll fall onto the else statment which doesn't accept statements. You can set these up in different ways to accomplish different tasks. Let's look at them below."

Since the i is contained by or owned by the for loop, it stops existing after the loop finishes, freeing that variable name for use in later code. This also applies to my result variable, if it was declared in the second loop, it would first, reset everytime the loop ran, and wouldn't be accessible after the loop finished. Final thing to note about the second loop is that we start with 0 when we could and end with 1 minus the initial number.
