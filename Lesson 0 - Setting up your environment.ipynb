    "\n",
    "IDE is an acronym for Integrated Development Environments. They are typically editors with a set of tools dedicated to a language. For python, I gravitate towareds one called PyCharm. The tools that IDE's include help to maintain syntax and proper editing. They also include tools for debugging that enable you to run your code line by line to help with locating bugs and other issues. Another benefit to IDE's is they will autofill commands for you and sometimes download necessary libraries without your intervention.\n",
    "\n",
    "Editors are just that, text editors. Python includes one with it's install called IDLE and it is very minimalistic and barebones. I haven't dabled in it much but from what I recall it's like the MS Paint of text editors but it lets you run python. That's the extremely basic side of this spectrum and then you have editors like Visual Studio Code. I've recently been trying to use it more because it's very lightweight and has tons of plugins that can help make it feel more like an IDE. It supports nearly any language and can be extremely useful when working on projects that use multiple languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What you'll be using for now\n",
    "\n",
    "For the first few lessons I have you setup in Jupyter Notebook. It's dedicated to python so it can be considered more of an IDE but it lacks some of the features of an IDE. We'll get to using an IDE later since they are a whole other beast to unpack."

    "Just a little bit of informative reading. Nothing too crazy since I don't know everything about this either. An Interpreted language, such as ya boi python, isn't directly translated to machine code, instead, the python interpreter takes care of that. Compiled languages like C#, are compiled directly into machine code making them faster since it takes out the middle man. Do what you will with that information, more of a fun fact for now but possibly a deciding factor for which language you'll use in a project in the future."
